# Broken Frontmatter Skill

This skill has valid content but its YAML frontmatter cannot be parsed.

## Setup

Use the CLI to install dependencies. Always validate your configuration.

```bash
npm install express
```

```python
from flask import Flask
```

- Step 1: Configure
- Step 2: Deploy
- Step 3: Verify

You must ensure all tests pass. Never skip the validation step.
Consider using a `.env` file for local development.
